If the limit for you is lower, you may press, "Quit game", in the top right after a round has been completed. If the limit is higher, you will have to ttrigger active mode for every new round that you start, as the extension will quit the game after completing ONE round.

* Autocompletion may not work on some videos or may require you to refresh the page and trigger active mode again.
